An alternative to Gravatar avatars that's quick and easy to use.

## Installation

You can run your own copy of tiley easily on Heroku:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/tommoor/tiley)


## Development

Tiley depends on imageMagick, on OSX you can install it using Homebrew:

```
brew install imagemagick
```

On Heroku it's already installed and on linux you should use your package manager of choice.

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will begin a process on port 3004 by default, so navigate to "http://localhost:3004" to finish off and wind up with a running Tiley.
