# Tiley

An alternative to Gravatar avatars that's quick and easy to use.

### Getting Started

Clone the repository to a local directory.

Run `npm install`

This will pull in the dependencies, then you have a simple command:

`node app.js`

This will begin a process on port 3004 by default, so navigate to "localhost:3004" to finish off and wind up with a running Tiley.
